## Technical Contribution Summary

### 1. Lizi Gujabidze
**Primary Focus:** Project Infrastructure, Code Quality, Documentation, and EDA Extension.

*   **Infrastructure & Orchestration:** Restructured the project into a modular format and developed `main.py` to automate the end-to-end pipeline execution.
*   **Code Quality & Standards:** Implemented NumPy-style docstrings, comprehensive `try-except` error handling across all modules, and managed dependency tracking (`requirements.txt`).
*   **Data Quality Reporting:** Developed the automated Data Quality Report generation logic within the cleaning pipeline.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Developed 3 advanced visualizations (Rating vs. Votes trend, Violin plots, and Category counts).
*   **Documentation:** Authored the comprehensive `README.md` and managed GitHub repository maintenance (branch merging, `.gitignore` configuration).
*   **Machine Learning:** Contributed to the initial Machine Learning logic and feature selection.

### 2. Nino Sadunishvili
**Primary Focus:** Data Processing, Machine Learning Development, and Initial EDA.

*   **Data Acquisition & Cleaning:** Developed the initial scripts for dataset import and cleaning. Optimized the data acquisition process by implementing a local download workflow.
*   **Machine Learning (Lead):** Developed and refined both Machine Learning models:
    *   **Clustering:** KMeans implementation for movie age vs. rating.
    *   **Classification:** Decision Tree implementation for rating category prediction.
*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Developed the initial set of 3 core visualizations (Rating distribution, Yearly trends, and Correlation heatmaps).
*   **Feature Engineering:** Implemented core feature transformations, including logarithmic scaling for vote counts and movie age calculations.
*   **Documentation:** Created the initial project documentation and README structure.
